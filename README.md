# VOICE BASED LANGUAGES TRANSLATORS AMONG FIVE SELECTED AFRICAN LANGUAGES. <br> 

Welcome to the Voice based language translator GitHub repository! The project aim to solve the challanges of languages Barrie's among african continent by providing a real time voice translation among five selected african languages(Hausa, Igbo, Sesotho, Harari) using some python modules such as gTTs, SpeechRecognition, PlaySound and GoogleTrans. <br> 
## STRUCTURE: <br> 
The repository is structured as follows: <br> 

backend/: This directory contains the backend code of the voice based Languages translator platform, including the API endpoints,technologies and framework, and business logic implemented in Python using the Flask framework.<br> 
frontend/: Here, you will find the frontend code for the voice based languages translator platform, implemented using JavaScript, React, and Redux. <br> 
models/: This directory contains the trained Generative AI models used by voice based languages translator to enhance the platform's capabilities. The models are implemented using Python-based AI/ML libraries, and they play a crucial role in solving specific problems such Errors in text or speech, domian specific labguage, ambiguity and colloquialisms and slang among the selected african Languages. <br> 
## PURPOSE: <br> 
The purpose of this repository is to provide a collaborative space for development and improvement of the voice based language translator platform among african languages. By making the repository publicly accessible, we aim to foster community engagement, allowing developers, contributors, and users to explore the codebase, report issues, and suggest enhancements.
## HOW GENERATIVE AI MODEL ARE SOLVING THE PROBLEM: <br> 

A voice recognition based tool for translating languages in real time. This tool could be used to translate the selected languages with voice data. For an example, it can listen and, translate that voice data into the target language then, it speaks out as a voice output, similar to a human translator, who listens and then translate in a targeted language.

This is not efficient like human translator, it is using the google translate platform as backbone to perform the translation process.
