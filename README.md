# VOICE BASED LANGUAGES TRANSLATORS AMONG FIVE SELECTED AFRICAN LANGUAGES. <br> 
## INTRODUCTION: <br> 
A voice based tool for translating languages. This tool could be used to translate five selected african languages(Hausa, Igbo, sesotho) with voice data. For an example, it can listen and, translate that voice data into the target language then, it speaks out as a voice output, similar to a human translator, who listens and then translate in a targeted language. <br> 

This is not efficient like human translator, it is using the google translate platform as backbone to perform the translation process.
## TECHNOLOGIES AND FRAMEWORKS: 
• Python 3.8 <br> 
• GTTs Module <br>
• SpeechRecognition Module <br> 
• PlaySound Module <br>
